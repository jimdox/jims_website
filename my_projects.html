                My current project I am working on is a real-time physics simulation renderer using modern openGL (4.5).
                The project is focused on simulations which involve particle systems or spherical objects and planes, but may eventually include some procedural geometry in the future.

                <h3>JPL Math Library</h3>
                <br>
                Jim's Physics Library is my supporting vector math library for doing computational physics projects. It also includes some other utilities I have found useful on these types of projects.

                <h3>Haskmat</h3>
                This is essentially the Haskell vector math library that no one asked for. It includes vector and matrix operations, as well as some other things that also probably don't belong in Haskell :P.
            </p>

                <h3>ORBT</h3>
                The OpenGL Rendering Basics Toolkit is one of my earlier projects which I used to learn openGL. It supports many of the same rendering features as the current version of Juno, but I ditched Java for openGL as I prefer GLEW to the LWJGL3 wrapper style of using openGL, since most references don't use this and because of some bugs with openJDK at the time.
