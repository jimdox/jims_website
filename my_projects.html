                The project I am currently working on is a physics simulation engine with real-time rendering in Vulkan, with the goal of running high-volume particle simluations. 
                To accomplish this, I've opted to use Compute Shaders to GPU-accelerate the motion integration of particles, which allows a nearest-neigbors algorithm to greatly 
                take advantage of the high thread counts in GPUs, and is faster than CPU-based implementations.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/ParrotMessenger" target="_blank"> ParrotMessenger </a> is a new side project I'm working on to build a fairly simple 
                peer / group messenger, and has been a great tool for learning the basics of computer networking.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/Eros" target="_blank"> Eros </a> is a fairly small math library, but that also comes with implementations 
                of some useful data structures.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/ORBT" target="_blank"> ORBT </a> was my first dive into graphics programming in OpenGL using the Lightweight 
                Java Game Library (LWJGL). This was a great learning experience for me to get a grasp on the basics of modern OpenGL and rendering techniques.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/Haskmat" target="_blank"> Haskmat </a> is a pretty simple Haskell library that has some data structures 
                that wouldn't normally be found in the land of functional programming. Mostly written as a joke.
