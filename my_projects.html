                My current project I am working on is a physics simulation engine with real-time rendering in Vulkan. If your hardware isn't well supported on Vulkan, there is a compatibility profile that uses OpenGL instead. </br><a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/Juno" target="_blank"> You can view the project here. </a>

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/jpl" target="_blank"> Jim's Physics Library (JPL) </a> is a simple vector math library which, although does not have the low level optimizations required to be especially fast, was sufficient for past, less computationally intensive physics projects, and is quite simple.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/ORBT" target="_blank"> ORBT </a> was my first dive into graphics programming in OpenGL using the Lightweight Java Game Library (LWJGL). 
                                        This was a great learning experience for me to get a grasp on the basics of modern OpenGL and rendering techniques.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/haskmat" target="_blank"> Haskmat </a> is basically the Haskell vector math library that no one asked for. It also includes data structures like linked-lists, queues, and some other things that also probably don't belong in Haskell. :P

                Soon I'll be starting a series of reimplementing a few example projects from my Computational Physics class in Juno! I will post some pictures here, but may start a blog to go along with the development.
