			Hi! I'm a Computer Science and Physics student at Syracuse University. <br>
			I have a pretty wide range of interests in Computer Science, but lately I've been focused on learning about Software Engineering in C/C++ and Computational Physics.
			<br><br>
			Right now I'm in the process of trying to learn about graphics programming in Vulkan, which has been challenging so far, as OpenGL and Vulkan are quite different in both their API and level of abstraction in general, so prior experience hasn't been as useful as I'd hoped. Thankfully this <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com">awesome tutorial</a> has been extremely helpful.
