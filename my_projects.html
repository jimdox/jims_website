                My current project I am working on is a real-time physics simulation renderer using modern openGL (4.5).
                The project is focused on simulations which involve particle systems, spherical objects, and planes, but may eventually include some procedural geometry in the future.
                You can view the project <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/Juno" target="_blank"> here. </a>

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/jpl" target="_blank"> "Jim's Physics Library" </a> (JPL) is my supporting vector math library for doing computational physics projects. It also includes some other utilities I have found useful on these types of projects.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/haskmat" target="_blank"> Haskmat </a> is essentially the Haskell vector math library that no one asked for. It includes vector and matrix operations, as well as some other things that also probably don't belong in Haskell :P.

                <a id="project_link" href="https://github.com/jimdox/ORBT" target="_blank"> ORBT</a>, or the "OpenGL Rendering Basics Toolkit" is one of my earlier projects which I used to first learn OpenGL. It supports many of the basic core rendering features that Juno now has, but was more of a learning experience and less of an 'application'.
